Colors consist of two bytes red, two bytes green, two bytes blue and two bytes opacity. Colors are assigned to cells in a four dimensional raster, from left to right for width cells, from top to bottom for height cells, from front to back for depth cells and from kata to ana for trength cells.

For every cell in the four dimensional raster, chunks define the difference in red, green, blue and opacity to their preceding chunk. The first chunk refers to zero red, zero green, zero blue and zero opacity instead. Differences are signed numbers, using the two's complement, in which a value is negated by flipping all bits and adding one. To keep differences as small as possible, red, green, blue or opacity may be wrapped. For example, a red of 78 and a difference of -100, result in a red of 65514.

Chunks count consecutive occurrences, to encode up to fifteen cells in one. An occurrence count of zero indicates that differences continue in the following chunk. For each red, green, blue and opacity, one cell encodes a difference of -64 to 63, two cells encode a difference of -8192 to 8191, three cells encode a difference of -32768 to 32767. Even if a difference is stored across multiple chunks, all chunks contain the sign in the most significant bit of the difference, so that
first_chunk_difference + second_chunk_difference * 128 + third_chunk_difference * 32768 = difference.
